## How to Edit Content

Pages are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), a simple markup language that's meant to look as much like normal text as possible. When the site is built, these pages compile to classic html. All Markdown files end in `.md`.

You can still use HTML in markdown files if you want. This comes in handy when adding things like video embeds from Youtube or Vimeo.

### Pages to edit

To edit the homepage, edit the `/index.md` file.

To edit subpages, find your page in the [/pages](https://github.com/miff-works/miff-works.github.io/tree/main/pages) folder.

Make sure to preview your file before submitting your changes.
